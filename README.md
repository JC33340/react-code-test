&nbsp;
# Overview
This is designed to test a programmer's skills in state management, DOM manipulation and local storage. The candidate should complete this within 30 minutes and not use any resources to help them complete this test. The candidate should develop on the react code to meet the Requirements and answer the question within the question section on the readme document. 


&nbsp;
# Goals / Outcomes ✨
- Using state and global state
- DOM manipulation
- Local Storage

&nbsp;
# Pre-requisites ✅
None

&nbsp;
# Requirements 📖
- Add dark-mode switching functionality to the *existing* dark-mode button
- Utilise the *existing* dark-mode scss file by adding a `dark-mode` class to the root `html` element
- Incoporate localStorage to hold state on refresh
- When in Dark mode:
  - The button icon should be `faSun`
  - The button icon colour should be `(#FFA500)`. You can use the `color` prop on the `Icon` component.


&nbsp;
# Question 💡
- How we would use Dark mode on other potential routes/components in a bigger application. How would you alter your solution for this?

Could use React context in a headless component/route. Wrapping children/outlet components which require the information. 


&nbsp;
# What's Already Been Done 🏁
- Basic app UI (mobile responsive)
- Dark mode and light mode styles/themes
